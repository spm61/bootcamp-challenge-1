# Description
This is a refactoring of a sample website, meant as the first challenge for bootcamp.  The objective of this assignment was to refactor the HTML and CSS files to contain semantic elements and promote better accessibility and search engine optimization.  

# Result Screenshot:
![This screenshot contains the resultant website after I deployed it.  It looks the same as the mockup because I didn't change the form of the webpage, only the semantic arrangement.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
