# Horiseon Refactor Challenge
This is the first assignment of the Coding Bootcamp Class.  This covers the basics of HTML, CSS, and Git.

# Description
This is a refactoring of a sample website.  The objective of this project was to refactor the HTML and CSS files to contain semantic elements (header, footer, main) and promote better accessibility and search engine optimization by defining alt-text for images

From this project I learned how to organize and comment a web-page according to semantic structure.  This improved accessibility and increased search optimization.

## Installation
N/A.

# Usage
Access the website using this link: https://spm61.github.io/horiseon-refactor-challenge/Develop/index.html

![This screenshot contains the resultant website after I deployed it.  It looks the same as the mockup because I didn't change the form of the webpage, only the semantic arrangement.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
